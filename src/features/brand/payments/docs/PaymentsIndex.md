# Design Document for Payment Feature Folder

## Overview

The `payment` folder within the `features` directory is responsible for implementing the payment-related functionality in the application. This folder includes the components, hooks, utilities, and tests required to manage, display, and process payments. The core component, `PaymentIndex`, serves as the entry point for payment operations, interacting with payment data and presenting it to the user. This folder is structured to handle actions such as rendering payment data, filtering and sorting payments, bulk payment actions, and displaying loading states during network requests.

## Folder Structure

The `payment` folder contains the following key components and subdirectories:

1. **`PaymentIndex.tsx`**:

   - The main component that renders a list of payments, provides controls for filtering and sorting, and allows for individual or bulk selection of payments. This component interacts with a custom hook (`usePayments`) to manage the state and behavior of payments.

2. **`hooks/usePayments.ts`**:

   - A custom hook responsible for fetching and managing payment data from the backend. It includes state management for payments, loading states, error handling, and utility functions to facilitate user actions such as selecting payments or performing bulk operations.

3. **`__test__/PaymentsIndex.test.tsx`**:

   - The test file associated with the `PaymentIndex` component. This file includes unit tests to ensure that the component renders correctly, handles user interactions (e.g., sorting, filtering, selection), and displays appropriate UI states (e.g., loading indicators).

4. **Additional Components** (optional based on implementation):
   - Components like `PaymentRow.tsx` or `PaymentTable.tsx` might exist to break down the functionality of `PaymentIndex` into smaller, reusable parts. These components typically represent rows or collections of payment-related data in the UI.

## Core Components

### PaymentIndex.tsx

#### Purpose:

The `PaymentIndex` component is the primary UI element for displaying and managing payments. It is designed to render a list of payments and provides controls for users to interact with the data, including search, sorting, and selection functionalities.

#### Key Features:

- **Rendering Payment Data**: The component fetches and displays payment details, including order number, referrer, campaign, date, total price, and payment status.
- **Filtering**: Provides a search bar that allows users to filter payments by referral name or campaign.
- **Sorting**: Includes sorting options (e.g., by date, referrer, campaign) to reorder the payment list.
- **Selection**: Offers individual and bulk payment selection via checkboxes, which users can manipulate to trigger bulk actions.
- **Loading and Error States**: Displays a loading spinner while data is being fetched, and shows error messages if there are issues with the request.
- **Action Handlers**: Integrates with action handlers (like `handlePaymentAction` and `handleBulkAction`) to allow users to perform operations on payments, such as accepting, declining, or processing payments.

#### Component Breakdown:

- **UI Controls**: The UI includes a search input for filtering, dropdowns for sorting, and checkboxes for selecting individual or all payments.
- **Payment List**: The payments are rendered as a list or table, where each payment is displayed with relevant details (order, date, referrer, etc.). Each row can be selected individually using a checkbox.
- **Loading State**: A loading overlay is shown when data is being fetched from the server, enhancing user experience by indicating that a process is ongoing.
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs while fetching payment data, an error message is displayed to the user.

### hooks/usePayments.ts

#### Purpose:

The `usePayments` hook is a custom hook that manages the payment data lifecycle. It fetches payment data from an API or state management store, provides utilities for filtering, sorting, and selecting payments, and manages loading and error states.

#### Key Responsibilities:

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves payment data, potentially from a backend API or other data source.
- **State Management**: Maintains the state of the payment list, including selected payments, loading status, and any errors that may arise.
- **Action Handlers**: Provides functions such as `handlePaymentAction` (for actions on individual payments) and `handleBulkAction` (for bulk operations).
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Exposes methods to filter payments by search queries or to sort payments by criteria such as date or campaign.

#### Hook Breakdown:

- **`payments`**: The main array holding all the payment data fetched from the server.
- **`loading`**: A boolean value that indicates whether the data is being loaded.
- **`error`**: An error object that holds any errors encountered during the data-fetching process.
- **`selectedPayments`**: An array that keeps track of which payments have been selected by the user.
- **`selectAll`**: A boolean that determines if all payments are selected.
- **Utility Functions**: Functions such as `setSelectedPayments` and `setSelectAll` are used to manipulate the state of selected payments. Similarly, `handlePaymentAction` and `handleBulkAction` are used to perform actions on the selected payments.

### Tests (`__test__/PaymentsIndex.test.tsx`)

#### Purpose:

The `PaymentsIndex.test.tsx` file contains unit tests that validate the behavior of the `PaymentIndex` component. The tests ensure that the component renders correctly, responds to user input as expected, and handles states such as loading and errors appropriately.

#### Test Coverage:

- **Rendering Tests**: Verifies that the `PaymentIndex` component renders without crashing and displays key UI elements like payment stats (e.g., "Accepted Payments", "Declined Payments").
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Ensures that payments can be filtered based on search input and that sorting buttons correctly reorder the payment list.
- **Checkbox Selection**: Tests that individual and bulk payment selections work as expected, with the correct payment IDs being passed to the selection handler.
- **Loading State**: Ensures that a loading spinner or overlay is displayed when data is being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures that an error message is displayed if there's a failure in fetching payments.

## Key Considerations

- **Scalability**: The `PaymentIndex` component and `usePayments` hook should be designed to scale as the application grows. The component should efficiently handle large datasets, and the hook should support pagination and additional filters.
- **Performance**: Ensure that operations like sorting, filtering, and selection are optimized for performance, especially when dealing with a large number of payments.
- **Error Resilience**: The component should be resilient to API failures, displaying user-friendly error messages and allowing retries where necessary.
- **Modularity**: The folder structure encourages modularity, with individual components or hooks that can be reused or extended. Future enhancements, such as new sorting or filtering options, can be added with minimal disruption to the existing codebase.
- **Accessibility**: The `PaymentIndex` component should follow accessibility best practices, ensuring that it is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. For instance, keyboard navigation should be fully supported, and ARIA roles should be used appropriately in the component.

## Future Improvements

- **Pagination**: Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large datasets more efficiently.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add more advanced filtering options, such as by date range, payment status, or payment method.
- **Bulk Actions Enhancements**: Extend bulk actions to support more complex operations, such as exporting payment data or sending notifications to selected referrers.
- **Internationalization**: Support multiple languages and currencies in the `PaymentIndex` component to accommodate a global user base.
- **Integration with State Management**: Depending on the scale of the application, integrating the payment state with a global state management solution like Redux may be beneficial for shared state across multiple components or pages.
